## Abstract
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<i>
Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are latent variable models that can generate complex objects and provide meaningful latent representations. Moreover, they could be further used in downstream tasks such as classification. As previous work has shown, one can easily fool VAEs to produce unexpected latent representations and reconstructions for a visually slightly modified input. Here, we examine several objective functions for adversarial attack construction proposed previously and present a solution to alleviate the effect of these attacks. Our method utilizes the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique in the inference step that we motivate with a theoretical analysis. Thus, we do not incorporate any extra costs during training, and the performance on non-attacked inputs is not decreased. We validate our approach on a variety of datasets (MNIST, Fashion MNIST, Color MNIST, CelebA) and VAE configurations ($\beta$-VAE, NVAE, $\beta$-TCVAE), and show that our approach consistently improves the model robustness to adversarial attacks.

## Experiments 
### Environment Setup
We list the required packages in `conda_requirements.yaml`:
```bash
conda env create -f conda_requirements.yaml
```

### Weights an d Biases Setup
We use w&b to track experiments, save and load trained models, thus it is required to run the code. 
Variables `USER`, `PROJECT` and `API_KEY` in the `utils/wandb.py` script should be specified before running the experiments.  

### Train VAE
Full list of hyperpaamters and their descriptions can be found in `config.py`

The folder `runs` contains bash-scripts, which can be used to run all the experiments. 
E.g. to train $\beta$-VAE on mnist dataset one can used this command:

```bash
bash runs/MNIST/train_vae.sh
```

The command below can be used to train $\beta$-TCVAE:
```bash
bash runs/MNIST/train_tc_vae.sh
```

### Attack VAE
To run adversarial attacks on VAE without defence:
```bash
bash runs/MNIST/attack.sh
```

And with the defence:
```bash
bash runs/MNIST/attack_and_defend.sh
```
